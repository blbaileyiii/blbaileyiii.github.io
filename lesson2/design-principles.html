                <p class="content-description">Visual Hierarchy is a technique that capatalizes on the fact that larger objects draw attention first. Using that a designer will make the most important objects the largest objects, and then reduce the size of items based on their importance. Naver Corp. uses Visual Hierarhcy to draw the reader's attention first to its primary banner where it advertises new content and increases the likely hood that a user will continue reading, and therefor potentially paying for content. Then the second largest element are the images and links to the users saved anime. The third element of size are the top navigation menu. Other elements are less important and thus significantly smaller.</p>

                        Example: <a href="https://buy.guildwars2.com/store/gw2/en_US/html/pbPage.pathoffire/themeID.4785548100?_ga=2.135200369.1194491716.1600968166-170880195.1568155358" target="_blank">Buy Guild Wars 2</a><br>

                <p class="content-description">Fitt's Law basically means that the closer an object is and the bigger it is, the easier it is to use. ArenaNet used Fitt's Law on the buy page by placing a very large and prominent CHECK OUT button at the bottom right of the page. Even if you scroll, the button remains fixed to that location, making it easy to reach with the thumb on the right hand. That thumb is typically what I use to navigate, and I assume many others do as well.</p>

                </figure>
                <p class="content-description">White Space and Clean Design refers to the balance needed by a designer between granting too much white space which will disconnect concepts and ideas, and placing too little white space which will jumble everything together and make it an incoherant mess. When used properly white space correctly groups items together using proximity and naturally draws the eye toward the important elements. In this example ArenaNet grups it lead banner and navigation at the top. It isn't perfect white space as there is some red/white artistic flare going on, but none-the-less it demonstrates an area that is truly void and creates a pleasing boundary. Next white space surrounds the main news cycler still at the top of the page. Finally, white space is used to group individual news entries below, and separate them from each other. Similarly the right side also utilizes white space to separate the three associated ads.</p>
